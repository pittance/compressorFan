compressorFan
=============

3d printable compressor-based desk fan

Scad files now largely complete
Base motor mount printed, needs adjustment for motor mounts (too low) and strain relief fixings for cables adding
Compressor printed, could possibly have higher sweep in inducer, could also have rear sweep on the edge + balance grubscrews
Compressor is working as far as is known given no duct (clearance may be very conservative)

Printed:
	Base motor mount (6h @ 0.2mm, 10%)
	Compressor (3h @ 0.2mm, 20%)
	Shroud (8h - 0.3mm, 5%)

To print:
	Base fairing (? @ 0.2mm, 10%?)
	Stands (?)
	
Whole design is 100% eyeballed, no calculations up to now.
I have a copy of "Gas Turbine Theory" [Cohen, Rogers, Saravanamuttoo: Longman] which looks like giving some relationships I can work with, we'll see if I can update if needed...

The shroud needs a major redesign, it is printable on Kossel machines but only barely, it's very wide (I needed to remove the z-probe retract tower) and very high, taking a huge amount of material. New one should be a little narrower, overall less volume
